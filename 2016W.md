Resources
---------

I strongly encourage you to take advantage of office hours. Other resources include:

* The Math Department has several resources for students including two labs:
    + The Math Studio in P220 is primarily for MyMathLab courses but is a resource for all math students.
    + The Math Lab in G014 is a very nice resource for getting one-on-one help with math.
* Smarthinking is accessible through eSantaFe and provides 24/7 live tutoring on any class taught at Santa Fe.
* Student Support Services has help available for qualified students.
